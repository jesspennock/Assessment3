            <h2>Me</h2>
            <p> Hi! I'm Jess and I like long walks on the beach. No. For reals though. It's my most favorite thing. Any day. Any beach.</p>

          <h2>The Zoo</h2>
            <p> I've been married to my hubby, Taylor, for 16 years. We have four boys ages fourteen to six. We also have three dogs, a green cheeked conure, and a crested gecko. It's messy and noisy and fun almost all of the time in our house.</p>

          <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p> I love to have outdoor adventures. Camping, hiking, rock-hounding, frog-catching, etc. are our favorite weekend activities. I also love music. I studied classical piano for about fifteen years (so you can bet my wpm is super high) and I would never say no to a country music karaoke night. My husband would definitely say no to that though, haha, so we don't do it often.</p>

            <h2>Career Goals and Ambitions</h2>
            <p> First and foremost I would like to become a really good software engineer. My plan is to specialize in Web Development. After getting a few years of experience as an individual contributor, I would love the opportunity to transition to project and people management. I know that managers with a strong technical background are a great asset to teams and companies.</p>
            <p>In my "wish-list-maybe-someday-goals" I have an idea to start a non profit that employees software engineers on the Autism Spectrum. My brother and my son  both have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. They both have the capabilities to be an incredible asset to a technical team someday, but the communication difficulties that frequently accompany these types of diagnoses are a real roadblock to finding success in the work place. I feel like a software shop with a balance of communication mentors and talented, neurodivergent engineers could be a really amazing thing!</p>
